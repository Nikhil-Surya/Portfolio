# [Project 1: Self-Driving-Car](https://github.com/nikhilwanshi/Self-Driving-Car)

* A self-driving car, also known as an autonomous vehicle, driverless car, or robotic car, is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input.
* A project that trains a virtual car to how to move an object around a screen (drive itself) without running into obstacles using a type of reinforcement learning called Q-Learning.
* The algorithm works using a reward system. I used Python and libraries such as NumPy, Pygame, Pymunk, Keras, and h5py.

# [Project 2: Fake-News-Detection](https://github.com/nikhilwanshi/Fake-News-Detection)

The topic of fake news detection on social media has recently attracted tremendous attention. The basic counter measure of comparing websites against a list of labeled fake news sources is inflexible, and so a machine learning approach is desirable. The intended application of the project is for use in applying visibility weights in social media. Using weights produced by this model, social networks can make stories which are highly likely to be fake news less visible.

* Our project aims to use Natural Language Processing to detect fake news directly, based on the text content of news articles.
* Develop a machine learning program to identify when a news source may be producing fake news. 
* We aim to use a corpus of labeled real and fake new articles to build a classifier that can make decisions about information based on the content from the corpus. 
* The model will focus on identifying fake news sources, based on multiple articles originating from a source.
* Once a source is labeled as a producer of fake news, we can predict with high confidence that any future articles from that source will also be fake news. 
* Focusing on sources widens our article misclassification tolerance, because we will have multiple data points coming from each source.

# [Project 3: market-basket-analysis](https://github.com/nikhilwanshi/market-basket-analysis)
Different products given 7500 transactions over the course of a week at a French retail store. We have library(apyori) to calculate the association rule using Apriori. Association rule mining is a technique to identify underlying relations between different items. 

* We have provide min_support, min_confidence, min_lift, and min length of sample-set for find rule.
* Support :- This says how popular an itemset is, as measured by the proportion of transactions in which an itemset appears.
* This says how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, expressed as {X -> Y}. This is measured by the proportion of transactions with item X, in which item Y also appears.
* Lift(A -> B) refers to the increase in the ratio of sale of B when A is sold. Lift(A â€“> B) can be calculated by dividing Confidence(A -> B) divided by Support(B).
